# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share with other people. When you want a backup of your code so you don't loose it.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically avoids unexpected changes to your code. Most
importantly it avoids unexpected conflicts.

# Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

* Forks create new repositories on GitHub.
* Clones create a link between a remote and local workspace.
* Branches give you inddependent areas to work.

Fork when you like someone elses work and want to start with it or when you
want to work with them.

Clone in order to have a remote for your work where you can share with
others on the same project.

Branch in order to keep your work all separate and independent.
