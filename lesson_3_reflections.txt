# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share with other people. When you want a backup of your code so you don't loose it.

# Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pulling automatically avoids unexpected changes to your code. Most
importantly it avoids unexpected conflicts.
