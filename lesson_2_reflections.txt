# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initilizing the repository creates the .git directory. The .git directory
and its contents allow git to recognize that this is a git repository and
track the status of the repository.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the link between the working directory and the
repository. The staging area gives you clear opportunity to adjust what
elements of the working directory go into the repository.
